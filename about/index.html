	<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
	<p>I was born in Mumbai, India but spent most of my life around the Bay Area in California. Living in the Sillicon Valley I was exposed to a technology centric era as I loved visiting local tech and robotics exhibitions. This was my primary motivator to go into the tech field. </p>

	<p>Growing up I was lucky enough to have ample opportuntites to explore my hobbies. In my early years I took up piano which I played during my free time and joined chess clubs, which I recreationally play today. During middle and high school I enjoed playing soccer which also led to running track and cross country in high school</p>

	<h2>Optimizing CTR with Deep Learning</h2>
	<h3>2015-2017</h3>
	<p>This is a project I started on sophomore year at Purdue through an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates grant 1246818. This would not been possible without the <a href="http://llc.stat.purdue.edu">Statistics Living Learning Commuinity</a> that I was part of that year, headed by Dr. Mark Daniel Ward.</p>

	<p>The project I worked is based on the fact that alarge part of electronic retail relies on understanding consumer product interests. This has led to the development of mathematical models in advertisement agencies to predict if the consumer they are targeting will click on their advertisement. Achieving the highest click prediction rate would mean that these agencies can pay to place their online advertisements effectively to target people most interested in their product. Most of these predictions are based on regression models. Our goal was to utilize deep learning models to achieve better scores than the known regression models.</p> 

	<p>The data that we used was from the iPinYou competition, where competitors were tasked to build a model that would achieve a high click through rate (CTR). iPinYou provided advertisement data from 9 companies. For each instance in the data we were given various attributes of the person that the electronic advertisement was sent to as well as if the person clicked on the advertisement. The data was originally split into different seasons of the iPinYou competition so the data for each advertiser had to be aggregated. After that, some of the variables had to be removed, spliced, or one hot encoded.</p> 

	<p>Once we had our data we tested our predictive power using a convolutional neural net and then a neural network model. Using our model configuration, we were not able to achieve higher predictive power than the regressions we compared it to, but the way we arranged our data made our models more interpretable to further analysis. </p>

	<p>When I was working on this project I was advised along the way by Dr. Xiao Wang from Purdue's Department of Statistics and worked with Dr. Quiang Liu from Purdue's Krannert School of Management. I am currently formalizing the results and plan to publish them to resreach journals here at Purdue.</p>

	<h3>2014-2016</h3>

	<p>Purdue Aerial Robotics is part of Purdue's IEEE branch and we worked on making an autonomous plane to fly in the AUVSI SUAS competition. When I joined the club had just restarted and we were esentially working from scratch.</p>

	</figure>

	<p>During the initial stages I was working on getting some lower level software to achieve stable flight with a waypoint system and tx/rx buffer controllers from the ground. I would later take on working on what we called the "ground station", which displayed flight diagnostics and plane location on a map overlay. From this station we would preprogram coodrinates that the plane would have to fly to, but it would be up to the planes systems to figure out an efficient way to naviate to these coordinates.</p>

	<p>Once we a plane up and running, I wrote a communication API to talk to the competition server. The server hosted a Django framework and could be accessed by HTTP calls while being reasonably secure (part of the competiton).</p>
