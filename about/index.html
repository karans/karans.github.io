	<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>
	<p>I was born in Mumbai, India but spent most of my life around the Bay Area in California. Living in the Sillicon Valley I was exposed to a technology centric era as I loved visiting local tech and robotics exhibitions. This was my primary motivator to go into the tech field. </p>

	<p>Growing up I was lucky enough to have ample opportuntites to explore my hobbies. In my early years I took up piano which I played during my free time and joined chess clubs, which I recreationally play today. During middle and high school I enjoed playing soccer which also led to running track and cross country in high school</p>
