<div class="About">
	<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
	<p>I was born in Mumbai, India but spent most of my life around the Bay Area in California. Living in the Sillicon Valley I was exposed to a technology centric era as I loved visiting local tech and robotics exhibitions. This was my primary motivator to go into the tech field. </p>

	<p>Growing up I was lucky enough to have ample opportuntites to explore my hobbies. In my early years I took up piano which I played during my free time and joined chess clubs, which I recreationally play today. During middle and high school I enjoed playing soccer which also led to running track and cross country in high school.</p>

	<h2>Optimizing CTR with Deep Learning</h2>
	<h3>2015-2017</h3>
	<p>This is a project I started on sophomore year at Purdue through an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates grant 1246818. This would not been possible without the <a href="http://llc.stat.purdue.edu">Statistics Living Learning Commuinity</a> that I was part of that year, headed by Dr. Mark Daniel Ward.</p>

	<p>The project I worked is based on the fact that alarge part of electronic retail relies on understanding consumer product interests. This has led to the development of mathematical models in advertisement agencies to predict if the consumer they are targeting will click on their advertisement. Achieving the highest click prediction rate would mean that these agencies can pay to place their online advertisements effectively to target people most interested in their product. Most of these predictions are based on regression models. Our goal was to utilize deep learning models to achieve better scores than the known regression models.</p> 

	<p>The data that we used was from the iPinYou competition, where competitors were tasked to build a model that would achieve a high click through rate (CTR). iPinYou provided advertisement data from 9 companies. For each instance in the data we were given various attributes of the person that the electronic advertisement was sent to as well as if the person clicked on the advertisement. The data was originally split into different seasons of the iPinYou competition so the data for each advertiser had to be aggregated. After that, some of the variables had to be removed, spliced, or one hot encoded.</p> 

	<p>Once we had our data we tested our predictive power using a convolutional neural net and then a neural network model. Using our model configuration, we were not able to achieve higher predictive power than the regressions we compared it to, but the way we arranged our data made our models more interpretable to further analysis. </p>

	<p>When I was working on this project I was advised along the way by Dr. Xiao Wang from Purdue's Department of Statistics and worked with Dr. Quiang Liu from Purdue's Krannert School of Management. I am currently formalizing the results and plan to publish them to resreach journals here at Purdue.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://purdueieee.org/partieee/">Purdue Aerial Robotics IEEE</a></h2>
	<h3>2014-2016</h3>

	<p>Purdue Aerial Robotics is part of Purdue's IEEE branch and we worked on making an autonomous plane to fly in the <a href="http://www.auvsi-suas.org/">AUVSI SUAS</a> competition. When I joined the club had just restarted and we were esentially working from scratch.</p>

	</figure>

	<p>During the initial stages I was working on getting some lower level software to achieve stable flight with a waypoint system and tx/rx buffer controllers from the ground. I would later take on working on what we called the "ground station", which displayed flight diagnostics and plane location on a map overlay. From this station we would preprogram coodrinates that the plane would have to fly to, but it would be up to the planes systems to figure out an efficient way to naviate to these coordinates.</p>

	<p>Once we a plane up and running, I wrote a communication API to talk to the competition server. The server hosted a Django framework and could be accessed by HTTP calls while being reasonably secure (part of the competiton).</p>

	<h2><a href="http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~tark/">Halberdier Club</a></h2>
	<h3>2014-2015</h3>

	<p>Halberdier Club is a community orginization that sets up hall and inter-residence hall events for Tarkington Hall, where I lived freshman year. I joined more in the sense that I wanted to push myself out of my normal comfort zone to actively engage with other students. I became a floor senator after I got a signed petition from most of the people from my floor. I also was responsible for inquiring what events my floor wanted and had to plan events that the Club was doing as a whole. I was part of the Well Being Commitee and worked on setting up charity and volunteer events.</p>

    	<figcaption>Our submarine, Barracuda</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>In AVBotz we built on an autonomous submarine to compete at <a href="http://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub">AUVSI Robosub</a>. The challenge what that I had little programming experience going in and low and high level proramming skills were required to write the autonomous code, sensor interfacing, computer vision, and motor control. We had a sparse budget and still had to raise the bar as Robosub was a collegiate competition.</p>

	<p> The first few years were spent learning basic C++, programming design and practices. We would also spend time learning the dauntingly large code file that contained all the code that ran Barracuda, our submarine. Later we refactored the code into a more modular and easy to read fashion. I would later work on implementing new tasks that were introduced during each year of Robosub. I would also focus on ways to improve image processing quality. This was due to the fact that the competition pool's water was not clear and there would always be debris and moss than threw off our processing systems. </p> 


	<h2><a href="http://acecoding.org">ACE Coding</a></h2>
	<h3>2013-2015</h3>

	<p>ACE Coding is an effort that started up based on the belief that everyone should have opporunity to learn programming and its applicaitons. We started in 2013 by creating some basic programming tutorials and exercices in Java and C++. We set up lessons at our local library and branched out to local middle schools as well. We kept the classes free as we wanted anyone from middle schoolers, to adults to have a basic exposition to programming.</p>

	<p>I originally taught a class on C++ and most of my students were in middle school. We got good feedback overall but I thought that C++ was still too advanced to be introduced as an introductory course. Students were able to utliize basic I/O and variable arithmetic. Topics like classes, pointers, includes and an overall understanding of what was occuring could not be grasped, as expected at the age. We developed a class using python which was better understood. I led a programming fundamentals course using Scratch, a visual programming language, which students had fun with.</p>

	<h2>iOS "My Pocket Solver"</h2>
	<h3>2012-2013</h3>

	<p>I was intrigued by developed processing power in mobile devices, espcially when I got my first smartphone. I played around with the iOS simulator through XCode just for fun, but when I got an iPhone 5, I was more motivated to try app development. The app idea came from the fact that our calculators could not solve equations easily, something that I valued in my math classes. Because of this, I wanted to make a simple equation solver. At the time there were a few solver on the App Store, but regardless I wanted the experience of writing and publishing an app.</p>

	<p>I spent a winter break learning Objective-C in order to throw together this app idea and was able to get an efficient solver. I would later add another tab that calculates basic statistical data given an input data set. At the time writing the app functionality was half the battle. I did not only want this app to run on the iOS simulator but also wanted to publish it. Getting it to be compatible with the App Store's security and basic standards took half the time. At publish time it took a while to get the final app through as there were always some errors in the setup and package configurations. When I did get it published, it was a cool achievement to have my work in the App Store, where anyone could get it.</p>
