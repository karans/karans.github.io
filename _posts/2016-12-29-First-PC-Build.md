Since my external GPU setup, I became interested in putting together hardware myself to run my work more efficiently. I used the eGPU as it was an easier solution to transport around when I traveled. 

Before coming home for winter break, I decided that I would build a PC for deep learning and selected the accordingly. There are comprimises to building a system, including CPU and motherboard architecture, storage, RAM, and a GPU, which I already had. There are a few [guides](http://timdettmers.com/2015/03/09/deep-learning-hardware-guide/) which discuss what hardware is worth buying to accelerate GPU operations. I also wanted this to become a productivity PC that I would use so some style points were added :). These are the parts I ended up buying. 

* Intel 6850k
* Corsair H115i
* Asus Strix x99 Gaming
* Corsair Vengance LPX DDR4 4x16 @2400MHz (2 sets)
* Samsung 960 EVO
* NZXT S340 Elite
* EVGA Supernova 850W
