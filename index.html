	<p>I am currently a student in Purdue Unveristy studying computer science and applied statistics. I am graduating in May of 2017 and am currently looking for a full time position in the field of statistics and data science.</p>
	<p>During the past few years I have developed an interest in data mining and machine learning and it is the track I am focusing on in my CS degree. I have been working on a project that uses deep learning models (more in about page) and am looking forward to participating in Kaggle competitons as well. 
	</p>
	<p>I have also worked on different robotics projects from middle school through college, focusing on autonomous vehicles. I had fun experiencing with autonomous planes and submarines and the challanges that go with each one. In high school I also took an interest in iOS developemnt as I published a statistical calculator.
