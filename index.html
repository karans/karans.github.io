	<p>I studied at Purdue University and graduated in May, 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S in Applied Statistics. I am currently working at <a href="http://www.neva.ai/">Neva.ai</a> as a Data Scientist.</p>

	<p>During the past few years I have developed an interest in data mining and machine learning and it was the track I am focused on in my CS degree. I have worked on a project that uses deep learning models (more in <a href="https://karans.github.io/about/">about</a> page) and competed at data competitions at Purdue as well.</p>

	<p>I have also worked on different robotics projects from middle school through college, focusing on autonomous vehicles. I had fun experiencing with autonomous planes and submarines and the challenges that go with each one. In high school I also took an interest in iOS development as I published a statistical calculator.</p>
