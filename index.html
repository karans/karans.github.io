	<p>I studied at Purdue Unveristy and graduated in May, 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S in Applied Statistics. Currently I am looking for a full time position in the field of statistics and data science.</p>

	<p>During the past few years I have developed an interest in data mining and machine learning and it was the track I am focused on in my CS degree. I have worked on a project that uses deep learning models (more in about page) and am looking forward to participating in Kaggle competitons as well.</p>

	<p>I have also worked on different robotics projects from middle school through college, focusing on autonomous vehicles. I had fun experiencing with autonomous planes and submarines and the challanges that go with each one. In high school I also took an interest in iOS developemnt as I published a statistical calculator.</p>
