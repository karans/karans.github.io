	<p>I am currently a machine learning Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech. My research interests are in feature engineering over graphical structures, and working on healthcare ML problems.</p>

	<p>I previously worked at <a href="https://astound.ai/">Astound</a> as a Data Scientist, where I built customer ML models and developed model prototyping frameworks. My research was in human-in-the-loop learning, which led to publishing <i> Active Deep Learning to Tune Down the Noise in Labels </i> at KDD'18 along with a startup research award. A copy can be found <a href="/documents/pdfs/ADD.pdf">here</a>. The procedure corrects a large number mislabeled text data used for classification by a neural network, while minimizing the number of re-annotations needed. This augments Astound's predictive capabilities in its IT and HR support use cases.</p>

	<p>I graduated from Purdue University in 2017 with degrees in computer science and applied statistics. I developed an interest in data mining and machine learning, utilizing deep learning models to predict advertisement clicks (more <a href="https://karans.github.io/about/">here</a>). In addition, I competed at <a href="http://llc.stat.purdue.edu/datafest2016.html">data competitions</a> within Purdue where my team had 2 days to provide novel insights to new, proprietary datasets</p>

	<p>I have also worked on different robotics projects from middle school through college, focusing on autonomous vehicles. I had a great experience working with autonomous planes, submarines and the challenges that went with each one. In high school I also took an interest in iOS development when I published a statistical calculator.</p>
