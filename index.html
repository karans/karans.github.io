	<p> I work at <a href="https://astound.ai/">Astound</a> as a Data Scientist. My interests in machine learning include human-in-the-loop learning, distant supervision, and inference modeling.</p>

	<p> Our paper, <i> Active Learning to Tune Down the Noise in Labels </i>, was recently accepted at KDD'18! A copy can be found <a href="/documents/pdfs/ADD.pdf">here</a>.</p>

	<p>I recently graduated from Purdue University with degrees in computer science and applied statistics. During school, I developed an interest in data mining and machine learning, utilizing deep learning models in my research (more <a href="https://karans.github.io/about/">here</a>). In addition, I competed at <a href="http://llc.stat.purdue.edu/datafest2016.html">data competitions</a> within Purdue where my team had 2 days to provide novel insights to new, proprietary datasets</p>

	<p>I have also worked on different robotics projects from middle school through college, focusing on autonomous vehicles. I had a great experience working with autonomous planes, submarines and the challenges that went with each one. In high school I also took an interest in iOS development when I published a statistical calculator.</p>
