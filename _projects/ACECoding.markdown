[ACE Coding](http://acecoding.org) is an effort that started up based on the belief that everyone should have opportunity to learn programming and its applications. We started in 2013 by creating some basic programming tutorials and exercises in Java and C++. We set up lessons at our local library and branched out to local middle schools as well. We kept the classes free as we wanted anyone from middle schoolers, to adults to have a basic exposition to programming.

I originally taught a class on C++ and most of my students were in middle school. We got good feedback overall but I thought that C++ was still too advanced to be introduced as an introductory course. Students were able to utilize basic I/O and variable arithmetic. Topics like classes, pointers, includes and an overall understanding of what was occuring could not be grasped, as expected at the age. We developed a class using python which was better understood. I led a programming fundamentals course using Scratch, a visual programming language, which students had fun with.
