I am currently a first year machine learning Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech. My research interests are in feature engineering over graphical structures, interpretable ML, and working on healthcare ML problems.

I previously worked at [Astound](https://astound.ai) as a Data Scientist, where I built customer ML models and developed model prototyping frameworks. My research was in human-in-the-loop learning, to correct a large number mislabeled text data used for classification by a neural network, while minimizing the number of re-annotations needed. This augments Astound's predictive capabilities in its IT and HR support use cases and was published in KDD'18.

I completed my undergraduate degrees in computer science and applied statistics at Purdue Univeristy in 2017. At Purdue I researched deep learning techniques for advertisement click through rates under [Prof. Xiao Wang](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wangxiao/index.html). This was possible through an grant that supported undergraduate research which was led by [Prof. Mark Daniel Ward](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~mdw/).
