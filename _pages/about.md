I am currently a machine learning Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech. My research is in the intersection of deep learning and symbolic reasoning, advised by [Prof. Le Song](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~lsong/). My other interests include feature engineering over graphs, interpretable ML, and healthcare ML problems.

I previously worked at [Astound](https://astound.ai) as a Data Scientist, where I built customer ML models and developed model prototyping frameworks. My research was in human-in-the-loop learning, to correct a large number mislabeled text data used for classification by a neural network, while minimizing the number of re-annotations needed.

I completed my undergraduate degrees in computer science and applied statistics at Purdue Univeristy in 2017. At Purdue I researched deep learning techniques for advertisement click through rates under [Prof. Xiao Wang](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wangxiao/index.html). This was possible through an grant that supported undergraduate research which was led by [Prof. Mark Daniel Ward](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~mdw/).
