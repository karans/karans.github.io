I am currently a machine learning Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech. My research is in the intersection of deep learning and symbolic reasoning to enable label efficient and interpretable learning. The problem domains I work are across vision, text, and time series domains. I am advised by [Prof. Irfan Essa](http://www.irfanessa.gatech.edu/) and also work closely with [Prof. Le Song](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~lsong/) and [Prof. Mayur Naik](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mhnaik/). My other interests include feature engineering over graphs, interpretable ML, and healthcare ML problems.

During my summers I am fortunate to have internship opportunties so far at Amazon and at IBM Research. I previously worked at [Astound](https://astound.ai) as a Data Scientist, where researched and developed human-in-the-loop learning systems.

I completed my undergraduate degrees in computer science and applied statistics at Purdue Univeristy in 2017, where I was advised by Prof. [Xiao Wang](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wangxiao/index.html) and Prof. [Mark Daniel Ward](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~mdw/).
